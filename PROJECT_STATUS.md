## Current State
<!-- One of: ACTIVE_DEVELOPMENT | MAINTENANCE | BLOCKED | PAUSED | SHIPPED -->
**Status**: ACTIVE_DEVELOPMENT

## What Was Just Done
<!-- Updated at end of each session. Most recent first. -->
- **Estate Constraints & Yield re-focus (Phases 1–2c).** Re-focused DealFindrs on 20+ lot estate land / house-and-land, deriving the assessment from property-services data. Source of truth: `docs/estate-constraints-yield-plan.md`.
  - **Phase 1** — Full `PropertyProfile` now persisted to `property_profile` JSONB (draft + create routes); null-zoning UX (manual-lookup link + `availableZones` picker) when derive returns `zoning: null` (QLD partial-coverage).
  - **Phase 2a** — Estate Constraints & Yield buildup engine (`src/lib/estate-buildup/`), Brief UI on the new-opportunity + opportunity pages, **derived yield is authoritative** (developer/anecdotal number is not a trusted input), feasibility-study yield gate for reconciliation.
  - **Phase 2b** — Estate Team Directory (CRUD + admin page + nav), state/occupation-scoped; kickoff team auto-assembly engine + gap detection; kickoff UI + light meeting log.
  - **Phase 2c** — Planner referral, adopted from F2K-Checkpoint's Planning Review shape (`planning_assessments` / `planning_findings` / `planning_finding_events`, migration `20260704010000`). KB-cited draft findings via the shared property-services `planning-retrieve` edge fn; planner review UI (approve/edit/reject/annotate, correction pairs captured); structured resolution (zone / min-lot / lots) flows back into the buildup with trace. Latest commit `ab9df3a` on `main`.
- (earlier, 2026-05-19) Adversarial Feasibility Engine — replaces the legacy soft RAG scorer. Three-test gate, lender-persona LLM reviewer with deterministic fallback, RAG mapping, real evidence upload. Branscombe V6 regression test is the merge gate.

## What's Next
<!-- Prioritised list of pending work. Updated each session. Detail: docs/estate-constraints-yield-plan.md -->
- [x] **2c routing follow-on — in-app assignment DONE.** Planner referrals now route to the state's directory planner (`route-planner.ts`; `planning_assessments.assigned_planner_id`/`assigned_planner_name`/`planner_gap`, migration `20260704020000` applied live). Referral POST routes on creation; PATCH reassigns; UI shows the routed planner + reassign select, or an amber gap banner → `/estate-team`. 8 routing tests green.
- [x] **2c routing — email push DONE.** The refer-to-planner push is now both in-app assignment AND email. Dependency-free Resend send (`src/lib/email/send.ts`), planner notification composer (`planner-notify.ts`), fired on referral creation + on reassign (both non-fatal, logged). `planner_notified_at` (migration `20260704030000`, applied live) records the send; UI shows "emailed {date}" / "no email on file". Sender defaults to `noreply@updates.corporateaisolutions.com`. **Note: `RESEND_API_KEY` must be present in Vercel production env for prod sends (it's in `.env.local`).**
- [x] **2d professional review packs — engineer pack DONE, QS/valuer Phase-3-gated.** Per-professional template registry (`src/lib/review-packs/`) rendering the Constraints & Yield buildup to a branded PDF via `@caistech/report-generator`. The **engineer pack** renders fully now (site header → yield summary → sectioned buildup with working+source → ⛔/needs-input/referral gaps → certification block); verified end-to-end (real react-pdf → valid `%PDF` buffer). QS (cost) + valuer (GRV/absorption) are registered but `available:false` until Phase 3 — no fake numbers. Download route `GET /api/opportunities/[id]/review-pack/[kind]` (Node runtime, 409 on gated packs); `ReviewPacksPanel` on the opportunity page. `next build` clean. **⚠ NOT DEPLOYABLE until the token blocker below is cleared** (lockfile lacks `report-generator`).
- **Phase 3 — Checklist 2/3 into the deal-model (grounded plan in `docs/estate-constraints-yield-plan.md`).** Decision: deal-model is the lot-based finance home; wire-not-rebuild; H&L is a layerable per-lot construction component.
  - [x] **3a — Bridge DONE.** Estate derived `authoritativeLots` now pre-fills the deal-model lot count (governs over `num_lots`), with a source trace + un-derivable→referral prompt. Buildup emits the `cost` gap.
  - [x] **3b — QS cost pack DONE.** Lot-level QS cost buildup (`src/lib/estate-cost/`) — land + civil/infra + soft + statutory + contingency per lot (benchmark rates × region factor via devfinance's engine), optional H&L home line. Unlocks the **QS review pack** (renders to a real PDF); feeds the deal-model per-lot inputs. Land-subdivision only for now (H&L layers when the deal-model carries a capture rate).
  - [x] **3c — GRV & absorption DONE (core).** New `src/lib/estate-valuation/`: GRV/lot (operator/study figure the valuer certifies) + a **two-phase absorption curve** (evidence-gated pre-sold burst → benchmark tail, monthly take-up vector; degrades to benchmark-only) + an independent **Domain AVM cross-check** (key-optional, confidence-gated natively by Domain's `priceConfidence`, degrades cleanly). Unlocks the **valuer review pack** (renders to a real PDF). Reality-adjusted from "real comps": Domain is estimate-only (no sold-comps table), so the AVM corroborates the site value, GRV stays operator-certified. `next build` clean; all review-pack + valuation tests green (24).
    - [ ] **3c-D (follow-on).** Feed the absorption monthly vector into the devfinance **feasibility cash-flow** (`sensitivity.ts`, replacing the flat even spread) so absorption moves the margin. Distinct integration into the feasibility flow — scoped separately.
    - [ ] **3c live AVM.** Provide `DOMAIN_API_KEY` on the property-services **Edge Function secrets** (not Vercel) to make the AVM cross-check live (it degrades to "indicative" until then).
  - [x] **3d — Bankable snapshot DONE.** Applied the `deal_model_snapshots` migration (`20260703000000`, both governance decisions were already resolved per the findings doc; stale header refreshed; FK-dictated to `obakurzlpzisflnnjzzo`) + a new `estate_pack_certifications` table (`20260704040000`) — both live. Review packs can now be **certified** (engineer/QS/valuer) via `/api/opportunities/[id]/pack-certification` + a Certify action in the Review Packs panel. The compute route **gates `grade:'bankable'` (v2)** on the QS + valuer certifications (409 with the missing list otherwise); the deal-model page offers "Save as bankable (v2)". `next build` clean.

## Blockers
<!-- Anything preventing progress. Include who/what is needed to unblock. -->
- ~~GitHub Packages token expired → blocked 2d deploy.~~ **RESOLVED 2026-07-04.** Installed via the `gh` CLI token (`gh auth token`; account `dennissolver`, `write:packages`) — no new PAT needed. Lockfile now resolves `@caistech/report-generator` (commit `b23055d`), so `npm ci`/Vercel build works. **Local-env note:** `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` in the shell held a non-GitHub value (`OBm2…`, 36 chars) and `~/.npmrc`'s `ghp_` token was expired — future local `@caistech` installs need `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token)` (or update `~/.npmrc`) until those are fixed. **Vercel watch:** first 2d deploy relies on Vercel's own `@caistech` token reading `report-generator` (same org as the other packages that already deploy — should be covered).
- **`@caistech/report-generator@0.1.0` ships a malformed ESM build** (`"type":"module"` + extensionless relative imports, e.g. `from "./render"`). Handled in DealFindrs via `transpilePackages` (Next) + `server.deps.inline` (vitest). Proper fix belongs at source (emit `.js` extensions) — same class as the sayfix-embed ≤0.2.0 issue. Worth a version bump in `cais-shared-services`.
- **Planning KB coverage is WA-only** (631 chunks in property-services `planning-retrieve`). QLD (and other states) are not ingested, so QLD referrals get no KB citations and are human-planner-only until each state's planning instruments are ingested into property-services. Not a blocker for 2c routing itself (routing works regardless of KB coverage), but bounds referral quality.

## Key Decisions Made
<!-- Important architectural or product decisions, with rationale. -->
- **Yield is DERIVED, not developer-supplied (LOCKED 2026-07-04).** DealFindrs computes lot count/yield from property-services datasets; the developer's stated number is not a trusted analytical input. Feasibility-study yield is admissible only to reconcile; anecdotal numbers are captured as a note. If a developer insists on their anecdotal number over the analysis → PASS on the project.
- **Buildup, not a data-entry form (LOCKED 2026-07-04).** Every derivable figure is derived and shows its buildup (number → computed from → source dataset). Free-text is reserved for genuinely non-derivable inputs, gated (e.g. only from a shared feasibility study).
- **Planner referral reuses F2K-Checkpoint's Planning Review shape (DECIDED (a), LOCKED 2026-07-04).** Adopt `planning_assessments/findings/events` on DealFindrs' own DB now + consume the shared `planning-retrieve` KB directly; design the referral record so a later `@caistech/planning-review` extraction is a lift-out, not a rewrite. Do NOT deep-fork Checkpoint's UI/agent.
- **The kickoff team is a system artifact (LOCKED 2026-07-04).** DealFindrs auto-builds the kickoff team from the buildup (core + drive-the-numbers + triggered-by-flagged-constraints + typology-matched supplier) and flags occupations with no state-panel member as gaps. Light meeting log (attendees, accept/decline, actions/owners) recorded.
- (earlier) Engine thresholds locked: T1 LTC ≤ 0.70, T3 margin ≥ 20%, forced contingency 5%/7.5%/10% by complexity. Legacy `assessments` wiped on migration 003.

## Active Branches
<!-- Git branches with in-progress work. -->
- `main` — production; all estate Phase 1–2c work committed (latest `ab9df3a`).

## Environment Notes
<!-- Deployment URLs, env vars needed, external service dependencies. -->
- Vercel: (URL)
- Supabase: DealFindrs project (see memory `supabase_project_refs`)
- Shared property-services `planning-retrieve` + `/derive` edge fns — same `x-api-key`.
